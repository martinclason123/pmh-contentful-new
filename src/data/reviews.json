They were very thorough and shared so much information. Their facilities were first rate. They asked us a lot of questions also. It was very important to them that one of their puppies was going to a good and safe home.",

After bringing him home, we received a follow up call from Paw Prints On My Heart making sure everything was going well and making sure we had no questions or concerns. We had a fabulous experience ❤️",
