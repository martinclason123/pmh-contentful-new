We couldn't ask for a better experience- from our first time contacting them to any time we have needed to contact them after her adoption, PCP has been amazing to work with! Highly recommend and will adopt from them in the future!",

    "review": "We are so very happy to have our little Clay in our life. He is so loving and pretty mild mannered for a puppy. He has bonded immediately with our other dog. He is already very aware of his surroundings and already knows his boundaries. He is very loyal to his human family and sits on point if something is out of ordinary; new vehicle pulling in the driveway. He is the perfect fit for our active family. He is so mild mannered that he travels so well and has already made a 700 mile round trip. He's not even a chewer. I can't speak enough great things about our pup and the breeder we purchased him from.",

Aaron was kind and accommodating when we wanted to look at the puppies as well as when we picked up our boy! We love our pup and he has fit in to our family so well. We receive so many compliments about him!",
