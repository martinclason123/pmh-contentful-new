      </header>
      <p className={styles.copy}>
        We, Richard and Wanita Martin, the dedicated and passionate breeders
        behind Paw Prints on My Heart, have been wholeheartedly committed to
        raising happy, healthy, and well-socialized puppies for over 10 years.
        Nestled on a beautiful 60-acre property in the picturesque countryside,
        our family-run facility is the perfect environment for puppies to grow
        and flourish.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.copy}>
        Each one of our puppies gets one-on-one attention daily to help them
        grow to be great members of society and to bring out the best of their
        personalities. Our puppies are all gently acclimated to crate time, they
        get to play with a variety of toys, and are introduced to many different
        surfaces, as well as multiple sounds, sights, and scents! Each puppy
        gets bathed & blow-dried every other week, to get them used to all the
        things that will be part of their future as an adult.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.copy}>
        The journey of Paw Prints On My Heart was born from both of us longing
        for our own dog as young children. As adults, owning our own dogs
        sparked a newfound passion for breeding and providing others with the
        joy of bringing home a happy, healthy puppy. Over the years, we have
        worked with multiple veterinarians & experienced breeders to carefully
        select healthy canines from specific breeds to ensure that we are able
        to offer you the healthiest puppy possible.
